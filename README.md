# Movies Land

This project is a movies app created using ReactJS. The state is managed using plain Redux, and the styling is made using the framework Tailwind.

## Technologies
This roject is created with:
* ReactJs: 18.2.0
* Redux: 8.0.4
* Tailwind: v2.0 

## Tools and packages
* For styling, I used the framework Tailwind.
* API: OMDb API is used 
* Form the API calls, the HTTP client axios is used.


### Notes:

* For movies that don't have a poster, I displayed the title and like button (the infos that are displayed on hover) in the result of the search list. In the movie detail, I used the logo.
